> An up and coming Rust Monero node.

[![Matrix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matrix-Cuprate-white?logo=matrix&labelColor=grey&logoColor=white)](https://matrix.to/#/#cuprate:monero.social)

Cuprate will be an alternative Monero node written from the ground up in Rust. It 
will be able to independently validate Monero consensus rules providing a layer of 
security and redundancy for the Monero network.

Cuprate will help to protect the network from implementation bugs that could 
cause a variety of issues, plus because it's written in a memory safe language Cuprate 
will be less likely to suffer from memory safety issues compared to monerod.
